Create dice mini game between two players. Each player will take turns shaking the dice until they reach the maximum points of 100 points. In the game, when the player gets the dice with the number 1, it will change to another player and the current points will reset. Therefore, players must be smart to secure current points by pressing the hold button and later the points will accumulate with the main points.
